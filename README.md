A command line tool for analysing data efficiently

# Installation
This code was developed using the Anaconda distribution of Python. This seemed to confuse tox and virtualenv. The resolution is:

* make sure Python 2.7.9 is available by running `conda install python=2.7.9`
* install pip with `easy_install pip`
* install tox with `easy_install pip`
